# PlayingAroundWithPandasAndSeaborn
Took Official City Based Pollution Data provided by Central Pollution Control Board(CPCB) Through Kaggle   
The dataset provided me with various pollutants that contribute to air pollution, these were in the form of columns.       
I removed those columns(indicators) that supposedly contribute less to overall Air Quality and kept the ones that are majorly responsibe for Air Pollution, i.e. PM 2.5, PM 10, etc.         
I focused my data set on the city of New Delhi and hence removed data related to other cities.         
I used various methods of Pandas to find out the months in which Pollution is at its peak in the capital city of New Delhi.     
I also tried to find relations between amounts of particular pollutants and their relationship with the overall Air Quality Index.       
I used matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize these relationships and also to provide a better understanding of the months in which delhi air is most unsafe.       
I came to the conclusion that June To September are the months in which Air Quality of Delhi is at its best while from October To January, it is very bad.       
The Delhi Government can(and does) use such findings to target Anti Pollution measures like ODD EVEN Rule, Air Sprinkling(or artificial rain), etc.
